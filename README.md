Hello, this is Vaishnavi. This repository holds my portfolio projects that I have created. 
The projects are in SQL and Python languages. 
The the objective of these portfolio is to display my skills in Data cleaning, Data Analysis and Data Visaulization.

About the projects
---------------------
### 1> Nashville Housing Data: Data Cleaning ###
Description: Did data cleaning of a dataset with 56000+ rows and 19 attributes using the MySQL Workbench. 
Some on the notable features used in the SQL Script are: Stored Procedureds, TypeCasting, Case statements, Join, Self Join, SUBSTRING(), SUBSTRING_INDEX() and common table expression (CTE).

### 2> Chennai House Price Data Analysis and Data Visualzation ###
This notebook analyses the Chennai House Price dataset to find the best location to buy affordable house. Python and python libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for the analyses and visualization. The various graphs/charts include boxplot, scatter plot(with reg line), bar graph, density plot, scatter plot(with confidence intv), violin plot, pie chart, etc that have helped in understanding the data better. 
Some of the notable questions answers are: 
* Total number of rows in dataframe with atleast one null value.
* Distribution of price in different locations.
* How predictable are the house prices in different locations?
* Cleaning NULLS in 'bathroom' column.

### 3> SAKILA DATABASE: Data Analysis and Visualisation ###
The notebook connects to the SAKILA database and explores the relation between various attributes of different tables in the database with the help of SQL queries and Data visualization.
Tools used: SQL, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn
Number of SQL queries: 18
Visualizations used: pie chart, donut chart, bar graph, line chart, boxplot.
Some of the questions answered:
* Number of films of each rating.
* Total number of unavailable films.
* Total monthly sales.
* Sales of different stores.
